# Brief Description
Develop a system using Wi-Fi sensing technology on Raspberry Pi to identify human activities or states in indoor environments 

# Proposal (Plan)
Our team aims to develop a system using Wi-Fi sensing technology to identify human activities or states in indoor environments. We plan to utilize Raspberry Pi to build a low-power system supporting various operating systems. 
- **The main objectives are as follows:**
1. Classify human activities and count the number of people
2. Monitor sleep states using Wi-Fi sensing and treat insomnia

- **Step-by-Step Plan**
1. Install Raspberry Pi OS and Nexmon_CSI
2. Extract and visualize CSI data
3. Identify the number of people and classify activities in indoor environments
4. Analyze data for monitoring sleep states and treating insomnia
5. Create an automated sleep environment by integrating with smart home devices
Progress

- **So far, we have completed the following tasks:**
1. Installed OS on Raspberry Pi 3 and 4
2. Installed Nexmon_CSI and configured AP mode
3. Extracted CSI data and completed initial visualization
4. Ongoing project management and collaboration through GitHub

- The next steps involve utilizing the extracted CSI data to identify human activities in indoor environments and using this information to monitor sleep states and aid in treating insomnia.

- **Conclusion**

  The proposal and progress have been outlined to ensure a systematic approach towards achieving our goals of utilizing Wi-Fi 
  sensing technology effectively.
